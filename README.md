### Hello 👋

Hi, I'm Donavyn. I'm a forward-thinking software engineer with a passion for merging the realms of technology and human biology. While I have a background in AI, my current pursuits lie at the intersection of neuroscience and technology, particularly in the domain of Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMIs).

- 🌱 I’m currently exploring the vast potential of BMIs and their applications in enhancing human capabilities.
- 🧠 I’m delving into neuroscience to better understand the principles that could drive the next wave of technological breakthroughs.
- 🛠 My experience in dynamic web application development and backend architecture is now being channeled towards innovations in tech-bio convergence.
- 👨‍💻 While my current projects are under wraps, I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead at the crossroads of computing and neural sciences.
- 👯 I’m open to collaborations that explore new frontiers in technology, especially those that push the boundaries of human-computer interaction.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
